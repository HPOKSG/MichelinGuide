    "introduction": "Orange banquettes and soft lighting enhance and offset the dark green wall tiles. Run by an energetic and passionate young team, Elgin can be relied upon to pamper its patrons. The menu, which changes regularly, showcases deftly prepared European dishes made mostly with local produce. Try the pork belly with fried brussels sprouts or gnocchi with lamb sugo, both of which are rich in deep smoky flavours thanks to the charcoal grill.",
